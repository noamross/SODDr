#Pseudocode for runs tomorrow.

# 1. Reproduce Cobb2012 infection results again

# 2. Reproduce Cobb2012 with 100 runs of demographic stochasticity

# 3. Reproduce Cobb2012 with the SDC hex grid

# 4. Reproduce Cobb2021 with the SDC hex grid and demographic stochasticity

# 5. Reproduce Cobb2012 with SDC hex grid using median spBayes predictions 
#  Main question:  Why instantaneous infection?
#   Possibility: infected UMCA already across the landscape?
# 6.  Reproduce Cobb 2012 with SDC hex grid and median spBayes predictions, demog stoch
# 7.  Reproduce Cobb 2012 with SDC hex grid and randomized spBayes predictions.  


## Coding: pull out initial work from loop
## Coding: make robust to run failure/error.  Ã¥
