Model is

 - spatially explicit, on a lattice
 - 
   
Total spore production is the spore production per tree

Per tree-spore production is a function of species, age, and time-since infection

Probability of detection is a function of species, age, and time-since infection

In each step, there are species and age-specific probabilities for

 - Advancing to next size class
 - Mortality
 - Recruitment
 - Recovery rate from disease

In each step, disease is distributed from the plot to adjacent plots via the kernel



Main issue - what about disease in the inter-plot areas
